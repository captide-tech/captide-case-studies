    "# Building a Dynamic Industry Classification System with Captide’s API\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional industry codes (GICS, NAICS) stick each firm in one box, but modern companies rarely fit neatly—think Amazon spanning retail, cloud, and media. Static labels also lag behind new fields like AI infrastructure or DeFi, hiding real risk links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Industry Classification (DIC) fixes this by clustering firms on live data—product lines, revenue segments, SEC-filing language—so a company can sit in several groups that shift as its business evolves. These data-driven clusters track financial behavior (e.g., return correlations) better than one-size codes, improving peer analysis, factor models, and portfolio design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Captide’s API supplies the fuel by allowing to provide clean information pulled from 10-Ks and 10-Qs with LLMs, eliminating manual parsing. In the tutorial that follows, we’ll:\n",
    "1. Fetch product/service text with Captide.\n",
    "2. Turn it into embeddings.\n",
    "3. Cluster similar companies.\n",
    "4. Auto-label clusters with GPT.\n",
    "5. Tabulate each firm’s multi-cluster exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll get runnable Python (requests, sentence_transformers, sklearn, pandas) plus Captide and OpenAI keys—enough to build a DIC pipeline that reflects today’s market, not yesterday’s categories."

    "### 1. Pull product-and-service text with Captide\n",
    "The first step is to collect data that accurately reflects what each company actually does. For this, we focus on the official descriptions of products and services found in regulatory filings. Captide’s API streamlines this process. It allows users to submit natural language queries and receive precise, source-backed responses extracted directly from filings. This eliminates the need for manual PDF parsing or keyword scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we query Captide’s `/rag/agent-query-stream` endpoint. The query asks: “List all the products or services of the company in a dictionary where each key is the name of the product and the value is a brief description.” We apply this query to a list of companies, retrieving data from their most recent 10-K, 10-Q, or 8-K filings. While our simplified approach uses only the latest reports, a more advanced implementation could iterate over historical filings to track how business activities evolve over time."

    "\n",
    "With a structured set of product and service descriptions in hand, the next step is to convert these texts into numerical embeddings—dense vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of each description. Embeddings are essential for comparing textual content: descriptions that refer to similar business activities (e.g., cloud infrastructure, digital payments, or logistics) will be positioned close to each other in the embedding space. This enables us to identify clusters of companies based on shared operational themes, even if the language they use differs.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we introduced the concept of Dynamic Industry Classification (DIC) and demonstrated how to build a simple yet powerful DIC system using Captide’s API, combined with modern natural language processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach illustrates how AI can unlock deeper insights in financial analysis. With relatively little code, we replaced rigid, static industry labels with a data-driven, multidimensional view of how companies operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Captide’s API played a central role—providing clean, on-demand access to the information buried in filings, which served as the foundation of our classification. In a real-world scenario, this framework could be expanded to cover hundreds or thousands of companies and updated continuously as new filings arrive—offering analysts a living, evolving map of the business landscape."

    "### Potential Improvements and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation is a basic prototype of a dynamic industry classification. There are many ways to improve and extend this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improve Accuracy with Better Models:** We used a general-purpose MiniLM model, but accuracy could improve with domain-specific or more powerful models. Advanced clustering methods (e.g., DBSCAN, spectral) might also capture more natural groupings than K-means.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Industry data is hierarchical (sectors → industries → sub-industries). Hierarchical clustering could reflect this structure, creating a dynamic taxonomy instead of a flat set of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fit into current GICS Classification:** An alternative approach would be to index the descriptions of current industries and subindustries within GICS and cluster companies' products based on proximity to each category. Outliers could be grouped into new clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Soft Clustering & Multi-label Classification:** Instead of assigning each description to one cluster, soft clustering or topic modeling can reflect overlaps—e.g., a product belonging partly to multiple categories. This better mirrors reality and supports embedding-based probability distributions over sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **More Data Sources:** Beyond 10-Ks, data like earnings calls, investor presentations, and proxy statements can add valuable context. Captide ingests these too, helping track trends like rising mentions of “AI initiatives.”\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Automation & Scaling:** A production system would automate data updates, re-clustering, and monitor cluster stability. Evaluation—both qualitative and quantitative—could ensure relevance and detect shifts (e.g., from acquisitions or strategy changes)."
