The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future.

The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks.

The Company applied a value-at-risk (\\u201cVAR\\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.

      "data: {\"type\":\"full_answer\",\"content\":\"As of March 31, 2025, Snap Inc. (“Snapchat”) had the following outstanding convertible debt (“Convertible Notes”) balances:\\n\\n- **2025 Notes:** $36.2 million principal, maturing May 1, 2025\\n- **2026 Notes:** $204.5 million principal, maturing August 1, 2026\\n- **2027 Notes:** $352.6 million principal, maturing May 1, 2027\\n- **2028 Notes:** $700.0 million principal, maturing March 1, 2028\\n- **2030 Notes:** $750.0 million principal, maturing May 1, 2030\\n\\nThe total principal amount of Convertible Notes outstanding was **$2.04 billion** as of March 31, 2025. These notes are part of Snap’s total debt, which also includes $1.5 billion in senior notes due 2033, bringing aggregate principal debt to $3.54 billion [#78e71523][#9cb8dcea].\\n\\nKey features of the Convertible Notes as of March 31, 2025:\\n\\n- **Conversion:** The notes are convertible into cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination, at Snap’s election. Initial conversion prices range from $21.68 to $89.25 per share, depending on the series. The conversion rates are subject to customary adjustments [#404d9fb6][#063a8101].\\n- **Interest Rates:** Stated interest rates are low, ranging from 0.125% to 0.75% (except the 2027 Notes, which bear no regular interest). Effective interest rates range from 0.19% to 1.21% [#404d9fb6].\\n- **Conversion Eligibility:** As of March 31, 2025, only the 2025 Notes were eligible for optional conversion; the other series were not eligible for conversion in Q2 2025 as the required sale price conditions were not met [#063a8101].\\n- **Repurchases:** Snap repurchased significant portions of its convertible notes in 2024 and Q1 2025. For example, in Q1 2025, Snap repurchased and retired $1.44 billion in convertible notes, primarily using proceeds from the new 2033 senior notes issuance [#7cddfc8d][#a8ad860e].\\n- **Capped Call Transactions:** Snap entered into capped call transactions to reduce potential dilution upon conversion, with cap prices above the initial conversion prices. As of March 31, 2025, the remaining capped calls were out-of-the-money [#d7baefff].\\n- **No Sinking Fund:** There is no requirement for periodic redemption or retirement of the Convertible Notes [#063a8101].\\n\\nSummary Table (as of March 31, 2025):\\n\\n| Note Series | Principal Outstanding (millions) | Maturity Date | Stated Interest Rate | Initial Conversion Price |\\n|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\\n| 2025 Notes  | $36.2                         | May 1, 2025   | 0.25%                | $21.68                  |\\n| 2026 Notes  | $204.5                        | Aug 1, 2026   | 0.75%                | $22.81                  |\\n| 2027 Notes  | $352.6                        | May 1, 2027   | —                    | $89.25                  |\\n| 2028 Notes  | $700.0                        | Mar 1, 2028   | 0.125%               | $56.34                  |\\n| 2030 Notes  | $750.0                        | May 1, 2030   | 0.50%                | $22.18                  |\\n\\n[#78e71523][#404d9fb6]\\n\\n**Key recent changes:**  \\n- The outstanding balances of the 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 Notes have decreased significantly from December 31, 2024, due to repurchases funded by the new 2033 senior notes [#78e71523][#a8ad860e][#7cddfc8d].\\n- The 2030 Notes were issued in May 2024, with $750 million principal outstanding as of March 31, 2025 [#78e71523][#96c104ff].\\n\\n**Total Convertible Debt Outstanding (Principal):**  \\n**$2.04 billion** as of March 31, 2025 [#78e71523].\\n\\n**Total Debt (including senior notes):**  \\n**$3.54 billion** as of March 31, 2025 [#78e71523][#9cb8dcea].\"}\n",

      "data: {\"type\":\"full_answer\",\"content\":\"The latest 8-K filings from AMD, dated May 19, 2025, report the following key events:\\n\\n- **Divestiture Announcement:** AMD has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its ZT Systems U.S.-headquartered data center infrastructure manufacturing business to Sanmina Corporation for **$3 billion** in cash and stock, which includes a contingent payment of up to **$450 million**. The transaction is subject to customary working capital adjustments and other items [#c8220000].\\n\\n- **Strategic Partnership:** As part of the transaction, Sanmina will become AMD’s preferred new product introduction (NPI) manufacturing partner for cloud rack and cluster-scale AI solutions. AMD will retain ZT Systems’ design and customer enablement teams, aiming to accelerate the quality and time-to-deployment of AMD AI systems for cloud customers [#c8220000][#c8220001].\\n\\n- **Transaction Timeline:** The deal is expected to close near the end of 2025, pending regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. This divestiture and partnership are consistent with AMD’s intentions announced at the time of the ZT Systems acquisition in August 2024 [#c8220000].\\n\\n- **Rationale and Benefits:** AMD expects the partnership with Sanmina to strengthen its U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities for AI systems and improve time-to-market for cloud customers. Sanmina’s expertise in manufacturing and ZT Systems’ experience in liquid cooling and AI infrastructure are highlighted as complementary strengths [#c8220001].\\n\\n- **Advisors:** Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor to AMD, and Latham & Watkins LLP is serving as legal advisor [#c8220001].\\n\\n- **Forward-Looking Statements and Risks:** The filings include standard cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, noting risks such as failure to obtain regulatory approvals, failure to realize expected benefits, and potential negative effects from the transaction announcement [#c8220002].\\n\\nNo other material events or financial restatements were disclosed in these filings. The focus is entirely on the ZT Systems divestiture and the new strategic manufacturing partnership with Sanmina [#c8220000][#c8220001][#c8220002].\"}\n",
